Meanhile I hope I'll be able to land this extremely addictive game concept, which I stumbled upon in my childhood. Who had brought me this idea - I don't know, but I remember playing this game once in elementary school and from that day I wished to recreate the rules and make fully responsive application. God it took so long.

The game called 'Stress' is standard 54 card deck game. It's all about speed and timing. There are no turns nor breaks except the 'Stress event'. Players move simultanously and their goal is to get rid of all of the cards. Game begins by dividing the deck into two halves for each player (only 2 players' game is considered at the moment, however there are ways to handle it with more people). Then each player lay one card in the middle, creating two stacks upside up. Next they shout 'Start' and take out 4 cards from their deck upside up, so it's clearly visible what the next moves are. Once they have 4 cards layed, they can get rid of them by adding them to 2 stacks in the middle following two simple rules: the card MUST be the same sign as the card it's laying on or the same value. The game progresses, and each time a player get rid of their cards, they must withdraw more to always maintain the amount of 4 in front of them. If there is the card with the same value on both stacks, the 'Stress event' can be triggered by a player who will shout 'Stress' first. The other person have to take all of the cards on the table and put them on the bottom of their deck. If both players shout 'Stress' at the same time, the event is nullified and game progresses as nothing happend. When there are no cards on the table or no player can move, both put one of their cards from deck like in the beginning.

There are some additionial strategies, that have to be taken into account when creating game. The joker card placed on any stack will always allow 'Stress event', because the joker represents all of the other cards. The next thing are penalty rules: 'Stress event' cannot be triggered without any cause, thus the person who shouts 'Stress' without any reason has to take all of the cards on the table. The player may want to take the cards on the table if there is the joker among them or to block the opponent, so the penalty is not always harmful. Players may also trick other person into shouting 'Stress' by putting other card on top of joker or matching card very fast, thus making 'Stress event' not possible and applying penalty to tricked player. The other strategy is to annoy other player by shouting 'Stress' over and over again and then suddenly coming back into normal play, which may heavily distract opponent.

I hope it explains in detail how the game works but I'm still open to any suggestions and questions. Regards -- Milosz.
